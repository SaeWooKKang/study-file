# MergeSort Pseudocode

- Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element
- Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with ohter sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array 
- Once the array has been merged back togerther, return the merged(and sorted!) array
